# Proximity Marketing App (PMA)

Using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon technology, this web application provides shoppers with relevant

and timely information about in-store products - straight to their mobile devices. Users can easily access

product reviews and price comparisons before making a purchase and also take advantage of special offers through

digital discount vouchers.

Combining the in-store experience, where a shopper can pick up and get the feel of a product, with the online

experience where reviews and product insights are at your fingertips - the PMA brings the benefits of both worlds

together.

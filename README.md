Using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon technology, this web application provides shoppers with relevant

and timely information about in-store products - straight to their mobile devices. Users can easily access

product reviews and price comparisons before making a purchase and also take advantage of special offers through

digital discount vouchers.

Combining the in-store experience, where a shopper can pick up and get the feel of a product, with the online

experience where reviews and product insights are at your fingertips - the PMA brings the benefits of both worlds

together.

  **Take this typical scenario:**

  A customer walks into an electronics store and heads directly to a TV she wants to buy. Standing in front of the

  TV she receives a browser notification on her smartphone. She clicks the link, upon which the PMA provides her with

  product info, product reviews, special offers and a price comparison with similar products.
